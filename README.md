# Super Tux War
A fan-inspired arena platformer built with Godot 4, following Super Mario War conventions. Battle in fast-paced multiplayer arenas where the goal is simple: stomp your opponents by landing on their heads while avoiding getting stomped yourself. Navigate 32×32 tile-based levels with precise platforming controls, one-way platforms, and hazards.
